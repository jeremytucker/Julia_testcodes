Please use this document as a list of alternatives to use the savio cluster from UC Berkeley in combination of the programming language Julia. 

The examples are motivated from the numerical methods literature and the main intention is to provide guidance on implementation. 

## Notes about Savio's operation 

## Implementantion of parallel code on a single node 

## Implementation of parallel code on several nodes
